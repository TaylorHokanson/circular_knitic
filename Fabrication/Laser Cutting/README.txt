All cuts made in 5.5mm/.25" acrylic
Cut order is Red, Green, Blue
You only need one gear, but we cut extras because they kept breaking teeth before everything was lubed and running smoothly

Changes:
All cuts distributed in the layers of one document
Color coded cut order
Deleted unused gears (for our BOM)
Deleted electronics housing (will post a different solution)
Reoriented stepper motor mount, control panel
