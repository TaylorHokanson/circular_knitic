### Generate gears in Inkscape

Large Gear:  
Pressure angle: 20 (common: 14.5, 20, 25)  
Pitch Diameter: 15" (Inkscape plugin requires inch)  
Teeth: 180  

Small Gear:  
Pressure angle: 20 (common: 14.5, 20, 25)  
Pitch Diameter: 1.5" (Inkscape plugin requires inch)  
Teeth: 18 

Open gears.svg in Illustrator, export as AI
Open gears.ai in Rhino
Had to resave each gear separately in AI for some reason

Used boundingbox to find true centers, added ref circle (PD)
Gear teeth feature many arcs, so be careful when centering!
