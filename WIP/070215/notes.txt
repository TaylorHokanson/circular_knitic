Through the presentation of these altered devices, my work positions technology as a metaphor for the body’s needs, desires and limitations. My body is me, though not the entirety of myself; it is also the conduit through which my abstract identity communicates with the physical world. This communication takes many forms, ranging from literal language to concrete action. Any act, though simple on the surface, is the result of a complicated and imperfect dialog between one’s abstract and tangible selves.
